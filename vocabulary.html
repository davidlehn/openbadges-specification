        This document describes a number of classes and properties that can be used to express authenticable claims by issuers about recipients in the form of Linked Data credentials. Each credential makes claims about a recipient’s qualifications or qualities. These claims represent either achievement of a particular defined benchmark as assessed by the issuer, or one or more properties of the recipient. When recorded and transmitted according to this specification, credentials are possible to be validated as authentic expressions of issuer’s trust in credential recipients.

      <p>
        This document describes a number of classes and properties that can be used to express authenticable claims by issuers about recipients in the form of Linked Data credentials. Each credential makes claims about a recipient’s qualifications or qualities. These claims represent either achievement of a particular defined benchmark as assessed by the issuer, or one or more properties of the recipient. When recorded and transmitted according to this specification, credentials are possible to be validated as authentic expressions of issuer’s trust in credential recipients.

        This entire document is a work in progress in very early draft stage. It is expected to evolve considerably.

      <h2>Glossary</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Credential</h3>
        <p>
          A claim from an entity(s) that denotes qualification, achievement, quality, or other piece of information about an entity’s background such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. 
        </p>
      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3>Issuer</h3>
        <p>
          An entity that creates and assigns credentials to recipients.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Recipient</h3>
        <p>
          Also known as the credentialee, an entity that is in control of a particular credential; who is typically both the primary subject of the information in a credential and the entity that initiates its transmission to a consumer.
        </p>
      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3>Consumer</h3>
        <p>
          An entity that is the end user of a credential. Consumers read, validate, and take action based on credentials.
        </p>
      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3>Requestor</h3>
        <p>

      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3>User Agent</h3>
        <p>
          A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the communication between parties on behalf of an issuer, recipient or consumer, such as the process of negotiating the response to a requestor’s request for a particular type of credential on behalf or a recipient.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Credential Management Service</h3>
        <p>
          A program, such as a credential storage vault, backpack, or personal credential wallet, that stores and protects access to an credentialee's credentials and can, on request, provide secure access to Requestors.  The software process involved is known as the Credential Agent. 
        </p>

            The claims made by a Credential are packaged as a Claim Set, a set of properties asserted about the recipient. Each claim is a property-value pair, where the issuer asserts one quality or attribute of a credential recipient or of an achievement attributable to the earner. The property name takes the form of an IRI, dereferencable within the document context to a term definition.

            A Defined Achievement (also known as a Badge Class) is a specific claim intended to be made about many recipients. A credential class may be specific to one issuer or shared between multiple issuers. It is defined with a name, description, may link to a page describing detailed criteria, and may be visually represented by an image. An issuer property may point to the entity that defined the achievement.
